# Bunger-Bot
A Discord bot with several general features as well as a completely customizeable economy system, as well as a dialouge system for... fun? WIP

Done so far:

I made a larger part of the user commands, as well as the proper guidance for the users;
although for the ones setting up the bot there isn't yet proper help for them to set up the bot.

still a work in progress, with no dialouge system yet, and many bugs

----------

So far there are a total of 25 commands, mixed with setup, secret commands, and user commands
These commands are:

<---Secret/Utility--->
-B#prefixcheck
-B#ping

-B#say

<---User Commands--->
